<title>Introduction - FSLeyes</title>
</head>

<body>
<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Introduction - FSLeyes</h1>


<p>This is the version of the FSL practical adjusted for use in PYM0FM, to be used on the CINN Nutanix Platform. Consequently, there are a few things you need to keep in mind:
  <ul>
    <li>The data is not stored in your home folder (~/fsl_course_data), and instead it is stored in the shared pym0fm drive, located at <code>/storage/silver/pym0fm/&lt;your DTS login&gt;/fsl_course_data</code>.</li>
    <li>We are using virtual machines that are preconfigured for neuroimaging work. Our researchers typically use both FSL verion 5 and 6, and to avoid conflict we are containing version of the software in modules. When you start a new terminal session, whether you start a new analysis, or you just closed one terminal, you will have to type <code>module load fsl6.0</code>, each time.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p><center>---</center></p>

<p>FSLeyes (pronounced <b>fossilise</b>) is the new FSL image viewer for 3D
and 4D data (replacing FSLView). It does not perform any processing or
analysis of images - that is done by separate tools. FSLeyes has lots of
features to visualise data and results in a variety of useful ways, and some
of these are shown in this introductory practical. You will also be using
FSLeyes throughout the course, so it is useful to get a feel for it, but many
more useful features will be included in the course.</p>


<p>This practical provides a quick introduction to some FSLeyes features that
you will be likely to use quite often. For a full overview of what FSLeyes can
do, take a look at the
<a href="https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~paulmc/fsleyes/userdoc/latest/">FSLeyes user
  guide</a>.


<hr/>
<h2>Getting started</h2>


<p>I have copied part of the FSL example data in the PYM0FM Silver drive, in folders for each of you: the path to the PYM0FM silver drive is /storage/silver/pym0fm. Please open a command terminal and type:</p>


<pre class="bash">
cd /storage/silver/pym0fm/
ls
</pre>

<p>This lists all the folders in the shared drive for PYM0FM. There should be one for you, with your university login as a name. If there is not, please tell me.</p>

<p>Then type:</p>

<pre class="bash">
cd &lt;type your login here&gt;/fsl_course_data/intro
</pre>

<p>Start FSLeyes by typing:</p>

<pre class="bash">
fsleyes &
</pre>


<p>The <code>&amp;</code> means that the program you asked for
(<code>fsleyes</code>) runs in the background in the terminal (or shell), and
you can keep typing and running other commands while fsleyes continues to
run. If you had not made <code>fsleyes</code> run in the background (i.e., if
you had just typed <code>fsleyes</code> without the <code>&amp;</code> at the
end) then you would not be able to get anything to run in that terminal until
you killed <code>fsleyes</code> (although you could still type things, but
they would not run).</p>


<p>Other useful Unix info:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To kill a job that is running (in the &quot;foreground&quot;) in the
  terminal just type <code>control-c</code></li></li>

  <li>To get a list of jobs running the background, type <code>jobs</code></li>

  <li>To bring something from running in the background to running in the
  foreground, type <code>fg</code> if it is the last job that was started.</li>

  <li>To force a job that is already running (in the foreground) to be in the
  background, type <code>control-z</code> and then <code>bg</code>. Note
  that <code>control-z</code> on its own will give you the terminal prompt
  back but the job will be sleeping, not running in the background, until you
  do <code>bg</code>.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<h2>Basic image viewing</h2>


<p>FSLeyes by defaults opens in the <em>ortho view</em> mode. If you add
image filenames on the command line (after typing <code>fsleyes</code>) it
will load them all automatically, and you can also add many options from the
command line. FSLeyes assumes that all of the images which you load share a
single coordinate system, but images do not have to have the same field of
  view, number of voxels, or timepoints.</p>


<div class="aside">
Type <code class="bash">fsleyes -h</code> to get an overview on how to use
FSLeyes from the command line.
</div>


<p>In FSLeyes, load in the image <code>example_func.nii.gz</code>, by pressing
<em>File &gt; Add from file</em> and selecting the image.

<p>You might need to navigate to the folder fsl_course_data/intro, depending where you were in the filesystem tree of folders when you launched fsleyes.</p>

<p>Once you selected and opened <code>example_func.nii.gz</code>, hold the mouse button down in one of the ortho canvases and move it around
- see how various things update as you do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the other canvases update their view</li>
  <li>the cursor's position in both voxel and mm co-ordinates gets updated</li>
  <li>the image intensity at the cursor is shown</li>
</ul>


<h3>Navigating in an ortho view</h3>


<p>You can interact with an orthographic view in a number of ways. Spend a
couple of minutes trying each of these.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Click, or click and drag on a canvas, to change the current
  location.</li>
  <li>Right click and drag on a canvas to draw a zoom rectangle. When you
  release the mouse, the canvas will zoom in to that rectangle.</li>
  <li>Hold down the &#8984; key (OSX) or CTRL key (Linux), and use your mouse
  wheel to zoom in and out of a canvas.</li>
  <li>Hold down the &#8679; key, and use your mouse wheel to change the
  current location along the depth axis (change the displayed slice) for that
  canvas.</li>
  <li>You can middle-click and drag, or hold down the ALT key and drag with
  the left mouse button, to pan around.</li>
</ul>



<h3>The display toolbar</h3>


<img src="display_toolbar.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 180px;"
     alt="Display toolbar"/>


<p>The display toolbar allows you to adjust the display properties of the
  currently selected image.  Play around with the controls and note how the
  image display changes (but leave the &quot;overlay type&quot; as &quot;3D/4D
  volume&quot;).
</p>

<div class="aside">
The word &quot;overlay&quot; is interchangeable with
&quot;image&quot;. FSLeyes uses &quot;overlay&quot; because it can also load
some other non-image file types suck as GIFTI surface images, and FIRST VTK
files.
</div>

<ol>
  <li><b>Overlay display panel:</b> Clicking on the gear button
    (<img src="gear_icon.png" class="icon"/>) opens a panel with more display
    settings. </li>
  <li><b>Overlay information:</b> Clicking on the information button
    (<img src="information_icon.png" class="icon"/>) opens a panel with
    information about the image. </li>
  <li><b>Overlay name:</b> You can change the image name here.</li>
  <li><b>Overlay type:</b> FSLeyes allows some images to be displayed in
  different ways. This should be set to &quot;3D/4D volume&quot; most of the
  time.</li>
  <li><b>Opacity:</b> Adjust the opacity (transparency) here.</li>
  <li><b>Brightness/contrast:</b> Quickly adjust the image brightness and
  contrast here.</li>
  <li><b>Display range:</b> Use these fields for fine-grained control over
  how the image data is coloured, instead of using the brightness and contrast
  sliders. </li>
  <li><b>Colour map:</b> Choose from several different colour maps.</li>
  <li><b>Enable -ve colour map</b>If you are viewing an image that has both
  positive and negative values, this button allows you to enable a colour map
  that is used for the negative values.</li>
  <li><b>-ve colour map:</b>Choose a colour map for negative values here.</li>
</ol>


<p>If FSLeyes does not have enough room to display a toolbar in full, it will
display left and right arrows (<img src="toolbar_left.png" class="icon"/>,
<img src="toolbar_right.png" class="icon"/>) on each side of the toolbar - you
can click on these arrows to navigate back and forth through the toolbar.</p>


<h3>The ortho toolbar</h3>


<img src="ortho_toolbar.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 160px;"
     alt="Ortho toolbar"/>


<p> The ortho toolbar allows you to adjust and control the ortho view. Play
with the controls, and try to figure out what each of them do.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>View settings panel</b>: Clicking on the spanner button
    (<img src="spanner_icon.png" class="icon"/>) opens panel with advanced
    ortho view settings.</li>

  <li><b>Screenshot</b>: Clicking on the camera button
    (<img src="camera_icon.png" class="icon"/>) will allow you to save the
    current scene, in this ortho view, to an image file.</li>

  <li><b>Toggle canvases</b>: These three buttons
    (<img src="sagittal_icon.png" class="icon"/>, <img src="coronal_icon.png"
    class="icon"/>, <img src="axial_icon.png" class="icon"/>) allow you to
    toggle each of the three canvases on the ortho view.</li>

  <li><b>Canvas layout</b>: These three buttons
    (<img src="horizontal_icon.png" class="icon"/>,
    <img src="vertical_icon.png" class="icon"/>, <img src="grid_icon.png"
    class="icon"/>) allow you to choose between laying out the canvases
    horizontally, vertically, or in a grid.</li>

  <li><b>Movie mode</b>: This button (<img src="movie_icon.png"
    class="icon"/>) enables <em>movie mode</em> - if you load a 4D image, and
    turn on movie mode, the image will be &quot;played&quot; as a movie (the
    view will loop through each of the 3D images in the 4D volume).</li>

  <li><b>Toggle cursor/labels</b>: This button (<img src="plus_icon.png"
    class="icon"/>) allows you to toggle the anatomical labels and location
    cursor on and off.</li>

  <li><b>Reset zoom</b>: This button (<img src="reset_zoom_icon.png"
    class="icon"/>) resets the zoom level to 100&#37; on all three
    canvases.</li>

  <li><b>Zoom slider</b>: Change the zoom level on all three canvases with
  this slider.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Multiple views: lightbox</h3>


<p>Open a <em>lightbox</em> view using <em>View &gt; Lightbox View</em>. If
you drag the mouse around in the viewer you can see that the cursor position
is linked in the two views of the data (the ortho and the lightbox
views). This is particularly useful when you have several images loaded in at
the same time (you can view each in a separate view window and move around all
of them simultaneously).
</p>


<img src="lightbox_toolbar.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 210px;"
     alt="Lightbox toolbar"/>


<p>The lightbox view has a slightly different toolbar to the ortho toolbar.</p>


<ol>
  <li><b>View settings panel:</b> Clicking on the spanner button opens a panel
  with advanced lightbox view settings.</li>
  <li><b>Screenshot:</b> Clicking on the camera button will allow you to save
  the current scene, in this lightbox view, to an image file.</li>
  <li><b>Z axis:</b> These three buttons allow you to choose which
  slice plane to display in the lightbox view.</li>
  <li><b>Movie mode:</b> This button enables movie mode.</li>
  <li><b>Slice range:</b> These sliders allow you to control the beginning and
  end points of the slices that are displayed.</li>
  <li><b>Zoom:</b> This button allows you to control how many slices are
  displayed on the lightbox view.</li>
  <li><b>Slice spacing:</b> This slider allows you to control the spacing
  between consecutive slices.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Unlinking cursors</h3>


<p>You can &quot;unlink&quot; the cursor position between the two views (it is
  linked by default). Go into one of the views, e.g., the lightbox view, and
  press the spanner button (<img src="spanner_icon.png" class="icon"/>).  This
  will open the lightbox view settings panel.  Turn off the <b>Link
  Location</b> option, and close the view settings panel.. You will now find
  that this view (the lightbox view) is no longer linked to the
  &quot;global&quot; cursor position, and you can move the cursor
  independently (in this view) from where it is in the other views.
</p>


<p>Close the lightbox view for now (click on the small red circle or X at the
very top of the view). </p>


<hr/>
<h2>Viewing multiple images</h2>


<p>Now load in a second image (<code>thresh_zstat1</code>) using
<em>File &gt; Add overlay from file</em>.  This image
(<code>thresh_zstat1</code>) is a thresholded FMRI activation image. In the
bottom-left panel is a list of loaded images - the <em>overlay list</em>.</p>


<img src="overlay_list.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 150px;"
     alt="Overlay list"/>


<p>The overlay list shows the images which are currently loaded into
FSLeyes. When you select an image in this list, it becomes the <b>currently
selected</b> image - in FSLeyes, you can only select one image at a time.</p>


<p>You can use the controls on the display toolbar to adjust the display
properties of the currently selected image.Select the image you just loaded
(<code>thresh_zstat1</code>), and use the display toolbar to change its colour
map to <em>Red-yellow</em>. </p>


<p>The overlay list allows you to do the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>Change the currently selected overlay, by clicking on the overlay
  name.</li>

<li>Identify the currently selected overlay (highlighted in blue).</li>

<li>Add/remove overlays with the + and - buttons.</li>

<li>Change the overlay display order with the &#x25B2; and &#x25BC;
  buttons.</li>

<li>Show/hide each overlay with the eye button (<img src="eye_icon.png"
 class="icon"/>), or by double clicking on the overlay name.</li>

<li>Link overlay display properties with the chainlink button
  (<img src="chainlink_icon.png" class="icon"/>).</li>

<li>Save an overlay if it has been edited, with the floppy disk button
  (<img src="floppy_disk_icon.png" class="icon"/>).</li>

<li>Left-click and hold the mouse button down on the overlay name to view the
  overlay source (e.g. its location in the file system).</li>

</ul>



<hr/>
<h2>Image information</h2>


<p>In the bottom right corner of the FSLeyes window you will find the location
panel, which contains information about the current cursor location, and image
data values at that location.</p>


<img src="location_panel.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 140px;"
     alt="Location panel"/>


<p>The controls on the left show the cursor location in &quot;world&quot;
coordinates (millimetres).  This coordinate system will change depending upon
whether your image is in native subject coordinates, standard template
coordinates (e.g. MNI152), or some other coordinate space.</p>


<p>The controls in the middle show the cursor location in voxel coordinates,
relative to the currently selected image. If the currently selected image is
4D (e.g. a time series image), the bottom control displays the currently
selected volume (e.g. time point).</p>


<p>The area on the right displays the intensity value and voxel location at
the current cursor location for all loaded images. Note that if you have
images with different resolutions loaded, the voxel location will be different
for each of them.</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Viewing time series (4D images)</h2>


<p>Now remove all of the images you have loaded (<span class="hint">you can
remove all images via the <em>Overlay &gt; Remove all</em> menu
option</span>), and load in <code>filtered_func_data</code>, a 4D FMRI time
series. Watch this as a movie by pressing the movie button
(<img src="movie_icon.png" class="icon"/>) on the ortho toolbar. The data
changes very subtly over time, so you may wish to adjust the brightness and
contrast in order to see the data changing.  Note that, when movie mode is
running, the volume index in the location panel scrolls through the different
time-point values. Note also that whilst the movie is running you can still
change the cursor position. Stop the movie by pressing the movie button
again.</p>

<div class="aside">
You can increase the speed at which the movie plays by opening the view
settings panel (<img src="spanner_icon.png" class="icon"/>), and adjusting
the <b>Movie update rate</b> slider.
</div>


<p>Re-load the <code>thresh_zstat1</code> stats overlay image back in.  Make
sure the <code>filtered_func_data</code> image is selected in the overlay
list, and open a time series plot view via <em>View &gt; Time
series</em>. Note that the FMRI time series data for the current voxel
in <code>filtered_func_data</code> is plotted in the time series view. </p>


<p>The time series toolbar allows you to control a few aspects of how
time series are plotted.</p>


<img src="timeseries_toolbar.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 180px;"
     alt="Time series toolbar"/>


<ol>

<li><b>Plot control panel</b>: This button opens the plot control panel, which
   contains all available plot settings.</li>

<li><b>Plot list</b>: This button opens the plot list, which allows you to add
   and remove time series, and to customise the ones which are currently being
   plotted.</li>

<li><b>Screenshot</b>: This button allows you to save the current plot as a
   screenshot.</li>

<li><b>Import data series</b>: This button opens a file selection dialog, with
   which you can choose a file to import time series from.</li>

<li><b>Export data series</b>: This button allows you to export the time
   series which are currently plotted to a text file.</li>

<li><b>Add data series</b>: This button &quot;holds&quot; the plotted time
   series for the currently selected image, at the current voxel.</li>

<li><b>Remove data series</b>: This button removes the most recently
  &quot;held&quot; time series from the plot.</li>

<li><b>Plotting mode</b>: This option allows you to choose from a few
  different scaling options to apply to the time series (e.g. demeaning,
  normalisation).</li>

</ol>


Search through the <code>thresh_zstat1</code> image until you find a
&quot;highly activated&quot; voxel. Press the add button
(<img src="plus_icon.png" class="icon"/>) on the time series toolbar to add
that voxel's time series to the plot. You can add more time series by moving
to new voxels and clicking the add button again.</p>


<p>If you have added several time series to the display, they may all have
quite different mean values, making comparison difficult - change
the <b>Plotting mode</b> drop down menu to <b>Demeaned</b> to demean all
displayed time series. You can also also choose to scale the time series
to <b>Percent changed</b>. (i.e. in this case you're now seeing the BOLD &#37;
signal change values). </p>


<p>When you are finished exploring the time series, close the time series
view. </p>


<hr/>
<h2>Viewing image histograms</h2>


<p>Image histograms give you an overview of all of the intensities within an
image. A histogram plots the distribution of intensities in the image; image
intensity is on the x axis and the number of voxels with that intensity is on
the y axis. Histograms are used as part of structural segmentation methods and
can be useful for QC purposes.</p>


<p>Close all overlays (<em>Overlay &gt; Remove all</em>). Open
<code>structural</code> and select <em>View &gt; Histogram</em> to view a
basic histogram.</p>


<img src="histogram_toolbar.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 180px;"
     alt="Histogram toolbar"/>


<p>The histogram toolbar is very similar to the time series
  toolbar, with a few extra options:</p>

<ol start="8">
  <li><b>Histogram type</b>: This setting allows you to control the y axis
    scale - choosing <b>Count</b> will plot the raw histogram bin counts, and
    choosing <b>Probability</b> will scale the histogram bin counts by the
    total number of data points used in the histogram calculation.</li>
  <li><b>Histogram overlay</b>: This button
  (<img src="histogram_overlay_icon.png" class="icon"/>) allows you to toggle
  an image on and off which displays all of the voxels that have been included
  in the histogram plot.</li>
</ol>


<p>When you are ready, close the histogram view and continue to the next
  section. </p>


<hr/>
<h2>Viewing FMRI analysis results</h2>


<p>Finally, we'll look at some more advanced FMRI analysis features in
FSLeyes. Kill FSLeyes, then switch back to your terminal and type:
</p>


<pre class="bash">
cd /storage/silver/pym0fm/&lt;your login&gt;/fsl_course_data/fmri/ptt/at/at_left.feat
fsleyes -ad filtered_func_data stats/zstat1 stats/zstat2
</pre>


<div class="aside">
  The <code>-ad</code> flag is short for <code>--autoDisplay</code>, which
  tells FSLeyes to automatically adjust the display properties for certain
  types of images. In this case, the <code>zstat1</code>
  and <code>zstat2</code> images are thresholded and given bright colour maps.
</div>


<p>You are now in an example FMRI analysis FEAT output directory. The image
  names on the <code>fsleyes</code> command line tell FSLeyes to load in each
  of these images, to save you having to load them in by hand in the GUI. </p>


<p>Because we are viewing a FEAT analysis, it makes sense to change into FEAT
  mode: <em>View &gt; Perspectives &gt; FEAT mode</em>. Then, on the time
  series toolbar, change the <b>Plotting mode</b> to <b>Normalised</b>.


<p>One of the nice features when in FSLeyes &quot;FEAT mode&quot; is that you
can see a plot of the fitted timeseries model versus the data. You can also
plot various other aspects of the FEAT model fitting process - click on the
spanner button (<img src="spanner_icon.png" class="icon"/>) on the time series
toolbar, expand the <b>FEAT settings for selected overlay</b> section, and
experiment with the settings.  If none of the settings mean anything to you,
don't worry - they will make more sense after the first FEAT lecture!</p>


<p>This FEAT output directory already contains versions of some of the images
upsampled to &quot;standard space&quot; - the common image space that
multisubject analyses are carried out in, which allows us to interact with the
FSL atlases. Close FSLeyes and run:</p>


<pre class="bash">
fsleyes -ad reg_standard/reg/highres.nii.gz reg_standard/stats/cope1
</pre>


<div class="aside">
  Note that in this case, the <code>-ad</code> flag configured
  the <code>cope1</code> image so that positive COPE values are shown in
  red-yellow, and negative COPE values are shown in blue.
</div>


<p>You might like to change the minimum display range value to 50, in the
display toolbar, so that only strong activations (high COPE values) are
shown. It is also possible to enable interpolation for the COPE image, to make
the blobs look nicer - you can turn on interpolation in the display panel
(<img src="gear_icon.png" class="icon"/>).</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Viewing Atlases</h2>


<p>Because these images are in standard space, we can turn on the atlas tools
with <em>Settings &gt; Ortho View 1 &gt; Atlas Panel</em>. Now as you click
around in the image you can see reporting of the probability of being in
different brain structures. You might want to resize the different FSLeyes
panels to increase the size of the Atlas information space (in general you do
this by dragging around the edges of the different FSLeyes panels).</p>


<p>The atlas panel is organised into three main sections -
<em>Atlas information</em>, <em>Atlas search</em>, and <em>Atlas
management</em>. These sections are accessed by clicking on the tabs at the
top of the panel. We will only cover the first two sections in this
introductory practical.</p>


<h3>Atlas information</h3>


<p>The <b>Atlas information</b> tab displays information about the current
display location, relative to one or more atlases:</p>


<img src="atlas_info_panel.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 200px;"
     alt="Atlas information panel"/>


<p>The list on the left allows you to select the atlases that you wish to
query - click the check boxes to the left of an atlas to toggle information on
and off for that atlas. The Harvard-Oxford cortical and sub-cortical
structural atlases are both selected by default.  These are formed by
averaging careful hand segmentations of structural images of many separate
individuals. </p>


<p>The panel on the right displays information about the current display location
from each selected atlas. For probabilistic atlases, the region(s)
corresponding to the display location are listed, along with their
probabilities. For discrete atlases, the region at the current location is
listed.</p>


<p>You may click on the <b>Show/Hide</b> links alongside each atlas and region
name to toggle corresponding atlas images on and off.</p>


<h3>Atlas search</h3>


<p>The <b>Atlas search</b> tab allows you to browse through the atlases, and
search for specific regions.</p>


<img src="atlas_search_panel.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 200px;"
     alt="Atlas search panel"/>


<p>The list on the left displays all available atlases - the checkbox to the left
of each atlas toggles an image for that atlas on and off.</p>


<p>When you select an atlas in this list, all of the regions in that atlas are
listed in the area to the right. Again, the checkbox to the left of each
region name toggles an image for that region on and off. The + button next to
each region moves the display location to the (approximate) centre of that
region.</p>


<p>The search field at the top of the region list allows you to filter the
regions that are displayed.</p>


<img src="atlas_region_search.png"
     style="vertical-align: middle; height: 200px;"
     alt="Atlas region search"/>


<p>When you type some characters into the search field, the region list will
be filtered, so that only those regions with a name that contains the
characters you entered are displayed. The atlas list on the left will also be
updated so that any atlases which contain regions matching the search term are
highlighted in <b>bold</b>.</p>



<p>Use the atlas search feature to locate the thalamus (left or right); you
should be able to see that there is activation here. </p>


<p>Spend some time with the atlas panel. Look at the information for some
other atlases (click the checkbox next to some of the atlas names). In
particular, the Juelich atlas is very complementary to the Harvard-Oxford
atlases (being derived from post-mortem histological segmentations), as are
the JHU atlases (being derived from diffusion MRI data). </p>


<p>Quit FSLeyes when you have finished looking at the atlases. </p>
