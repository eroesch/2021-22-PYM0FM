<h2><a name="ptt">Paired t-test</a></h2>

<p>
We have a group of six subjects, each scanned twice: once doing motor tasks
with their left hand, and once with their right hand. This is a stroke study, and
hence comparing left and right motor function is particularly interesting in
this case. Within each run, subjects completed different blocks of index
finger movement, sequential finger movement and random finger movement.
</p>


<p>
<b>Research question</b>:
Is there a significant left vs right hand finger movement paired-difference,
generalisable to the population from which the subjects are drawn?
</p>


<p>
To address this, we want the <i>left &minus; right</i> paired mean
difference within a mixed effects model, taking into account the within-subject
fixed effects variances and the between-subject random effect variance. This
is done as a two-level analysis with the following structure:
</p>


<ul>
<li><b>Level 1: Single-session analyses</b> There are 6 subjects &times;
2 sessions = 12 first-level FEAT analyses. These have already been done
for you.</li>

<li><b>Level 2: Between-subject analysis</b> We do a separate second-level
analysis for each of the first-level contrasts, and estimate the mean (paired)
difference for each.</li>
</ul>


<p>
In FSL terminology, each contrast is represented by a COPE (contrast of
parameter estimate), and it is these which we pass up to any higher-level
analysis. Note that as well as the COPEs, FEAT passes the variance of these
COPEs (VARCOPEs), and even the uncertainty in the variance of these
COPEs (DOFs; degrees-of-freedom), between the different levels.

<h3>First-level analyses</h3>


<p>
Each first-level analysis contains 6 contrasts, each related to the different 
types of finger tapping performed in the scanner
(e.g. mean response over the different conditions, index finger only, etc.). Thus
there are 6 COPEs in the <code>stats</code> subdirectory of each
first-level <code>.feat</code> directory. A higher-level FEAT analysis 
entails an independent analysis on each of these contrasts (i.e. a second-level analysis
of all subjects' first-level <i>mean</i> contrasts, a separate
second-level analysis of all first-level <i>index</i> contrasts,
etc.). Each of these second-level analyses is performed simultaneously and will form a
separate <code>cope?.feat</code> directory inside a
newly-created <code>.gfeat</code> directory.
</p>


<pre class="bash">
cd ~/fsl_course_data/fmri2/paired_ttest
</pre>


<p>The first-level analyses are held in 6 different directories within
<code>~/fsl_course_data/fmri2/paired_ttest</code>, one for each subject. The
subject directories are <code>ac at cm df dn eg</code>. There are two
first-level FEAT directories within each of these, and these have already
been run for you. Have a quick look at one of the lower-level reports if 
you want to familiarise yourself with the study design and data.
</p>


<!-- ++++++++++ -->

<h3>FEAT set-up</h3>


<p>
Open FEAT (<code class="bash">Feat &amp;</code> or
[<code class="bash">Feat_gui &amp;</code> on a mac]) and follow the
instructions below to set up the higher-level analysis.
</p>


<p>
First, change <b>First-level analysis</b> to <b>Higher-level analysis</b> in
the drop down box at the top.
</p>


<h4>Data</h4>


<p>Here we are going to set up the input data for our higher level
analysis. First, change the <b>Number of inputs</b> to 12 (i.e. 6 subjects
&times; 2 sessions).</p


<p>Press <b>Select FEAT directories</b>.  At this stage, you need to decide on
a <em>sensible</em> order for the first-level analyses. You could choose to
group the analyses by subject (i.e. <code>ac/ac_left.feat</code>,
<code>ac/ac_right.feat</code>, <code>at/at_left.feat</code>, etc.), or you
could group by condition (i.e. <code>ac/ac_left.feat</code>,
<code>at/at_left.feat</code>, &#8230;, <code>ac/ac_right.feat</code>, etc.).
We recommend the latter option, because this matches the
<a href="../../../../fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide.html#Paired_Two-Group_Difference_.28Two-Sample_Paired_T-Test.29"
target="dynamic">example paired t-test in the FEAT manual</a>, and also
matches the way the paired t-test is set up for you if you use the <b>Model
setup wizard</b> (explained below).</p>


<p>You can often avoid having to tediously hand-select each of these
first-level FEAT directories separately, using the <b>Paste</b> button. If you
press this, a new free-text window comes up, within which you can paste text
(in this case the list of first-level FEAT directories) which you can copy,
e.g. from a list in a terminal. Press <b>Clear</b> to clear the text
window. Then in your terminal, making sure you are inside the
<code>paired_ttest</code> directory, type: </p>


<pre class="bash">
ls -d1 "$PWD"/??/??_left.feat ; ls -d1 "$PWD"/??/??_right.feat
</pre>


<p>How does this command work?
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt('parametric#f-test')">Answer.</span>
This should give you a complete listing of the full pathnames of the FEAT
directories in the right order. You can now highlight this list with the
mouse, and paste it into the FEAT paste window with the middle mouse
button, or by clicking in the paste window and
pressing <code>control-y</code>. </p>


<div id="parametric#f-test" class="answer" style="display: none">
<code>ls -1d</code> lists a set of files or
directories. The <code>-1</code> flag prints each result on a separate
line, and <code>-d</code> means that only directory names, rather than
their contents, are shown. The <code>"$PWD"</code> part fills out the full
pathname of the current directory. The <code>?</code> characters are
expanded by the shell to fit any single character, in alphabetical
order. The command is repeated so that the <code>_left</code> FEAT
directories are listed first, and then all the <code>_right</code>. </div>

<p> To save time, we will only pass the <i>mean</i> contrast up to the top 
level. Make sure that <b>ONLY</b> contrast 1 is selected in the <b>Use
lower-level copes</b> boxes.</p>

<p>When this is done, set the <b>Output directory</b> to
<code>paired_ttest_ols</code> (the full path will end up as
<code>/home/$HOME/fsl_course_data/fmri2/paired_ttest/paired_ttest_ols.gfeat</code>).</p>


<h4>Stats</h4>


<p>Select the <b>Mixed Effects: Simple OLS</b> option from the top drop down
box.  Also, make sure that the <b>Use automatic outlier de-weighting</b>
button is <b>NOT</b> turned on. It is important that these two settings are
chosen, otherwise the analysis will not be quick enough to be of use to you in
the time that we have available for the practical.  Normally, we recommend
that the more accurate "Mixed Effects: FLAME 1" option is used in
combination with outlier de-weighting, for the reasons outlined in the
lectures. However, in the interest of speed, in this practical we choose the
faster OLS option without outlier de-weighting. </p>

<p> With this design you can use the <b>Model setup wizard</b>, which provides
an easy way of setting up a few simple designs. Select <b>two groups,
paired</b> and press <b>Process</b>. You will now see the design matrix that
has been created for you.</p>

<p>To understand how this is controlled in detail, click on <b>Full model
setup</b>.</p>

<ul class="pad-after">
  <li>The inputs (<em>Input 1</em> to <em>Input 12</em>) correspond to the
  order you entered the first-level FEAT directories&mdash;it
  is <em>essential</em> that your design matches the order you entered the
  lower level directories under the <b>Data</b> tab! Note also that the first
  column, labelled <em>Group</em>, corresponds to groupings of inputs that
  will share the same random effects (RE) variance in this level of the
  model. Here, we let all subjects have the same RE variance (i.e. the
  <em>Group</em> column should be left as all 1s). </li>

  <li>There are 7 EVs: EV 1 models the <i>left &minus; right</i> paired
  difference, and EVs 2-7 are confounds which model out each subject's mean
  (this is what makes the design a paired t-test).</li>

  <li>Click on the <b>Contrasts &amp; F-tests</b> tab. There are two contrasts
  set up for you by the wizard. EVs 2-7 are confounds of no interest and so do
  not appear in the contrasts. Hence, the contrasts only involve EV1. Change
  the <b>Titles</b> boxes to read <i>left &gt; right</i> and <i>right &gt;
  left</i>.</li>

  <li> Press <b>Done</b>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Post-stats</h4>


<p>Because we only use a small number of subjects in order to make it possible 
to run the analysis in the practical session, we will reduce the cluster 
threshold slightly. This will allow us to see some more results, but is 
<b>NOT</b> recommended for your own analyses. In the <b>Thresholding</b> box 
change the <b>Z threshold</b> to 2.3.</p>


<h4>Go!</h4>


<p>Press <b>Go</b>! The web browser that appears monitors the overall progress.
This second-level analysis should take about 5 minutes. While you're waiting, 
either make a cup of tea (but do <b><u><i>NOT</b></u></i> add milk while the bag is 
still in the water) or familiarise yourself with the 
introduction to the next major section of the practical on group analyses with multiple sessions per
subject.
</p>

<!-- ++++++++++ -->

<h4>Results</h4>


<p>
Higher-level FEAT runs produce <code>.gfeat</code> directories. Once the
analysis has finished, explore the web report. This top-level report provides
links to the previous level reports, a registration summary page and links to
the separate higher-level reports.
</p>


<p>
<b><em>LOOK AT YOUR DATA</em></b>!  In particular it is always important to
check the registration summary report page very carefully, to ensure that all
lower-level registrations succeeded. If any of the lower-level FEATs look like
the registration has failed badly, you need to fix this before re-running the
higher-level FEAT analysis. Note that field maps were not acquired with this 
data&mdash;you should be able to spot this on the registration page!
</p>


<p>
In the results page you get a link to the group results from running the
group-level analysis on each first-level contrast. Within each contrast you
get a group-level results page showing the standard post-stats output.
However, note that the <em>time course</em> outputs in these higher-level
results no longer refer to <em>time</em> (despite the heading).  They refer to
subject (or session) number. In this case that is the 12 sessions (6 subjects
&times; 2 conditions) in the study, and it is effect size shown on the
vertical axis, rather than normalised MRI signal.  Have a look at this and the
other parts of the results webpage and make sure you understand what is being
shown.
</p>


<!-- ++++++++++ -->

<h4>Pre-baked analyses</h4>

<p>
We have run a full analysis for you on this data (i.e. on all the contrasts, 
using FLAME for statistics, and with 
the recommended Z-thresholds). Take a quick look at this report as well.
</p>

<pre class="bash">
firefox examples/flame.gfeat/report.html &
</pre>

<p>
Can you spot any major differences between the two analyses?
</p>

<!-- ++++++++++ -->

<!--
<h4>Optional extras</h4>

<p>
If you get spare time at the end of this session, there are
two other analyses of interest:
</p>


<ul class="pad-after">

  <li>In the FEAT GUI, load in the <code>design.fsf</code> from the
  <code>.gfeat</code> directory. Change the modelling/estimation method to
  <b>Mixed Effects: FLAME 1</b>, which is nearly as accurate as full FLAME and
  nearly as fast as OLS. Change the output directory name to reflect this
  option. Under the <b>Data</b> tab, deselect all of the <em>lower-level
  copes</em> except 2 - this tells the group FEAT to only run the second-level
  analysis on the second of the first-level contrasts, not all 5. After
  completion (5-10 minutes), compare with the OLS results. The FLAME results
  do look &quot;nicer&quot;, as well as there being some new plausible
  activations that were not previously found.</li>

  <li>Whilst the above is running, get another analysis ready to
  run&mdash;revert to the OLS option, and change the model to the simpler
  unpaired t-test (use the wizard, and make sure that you understand the EVs
  and contrasts that the wizard sets up for you), re-run and compare with the
  paired t-test results (note: you may not see any significant activations
  with the unpaired test).</li>
</ul>
-->

<hr/>
<h2><a name="multisession">Group analysis with multiple sessions for each
subject</a></h2>


<p>
It is common to split a task up into multiple short scans instead of having one long scan.
This can often help to reduce subject movement in the scans, and also to keep the attention of your participant.
As a result, we need to combine data across multiple scanning sessions using a three-level FEAT analysis.
</p>


<p>
The data consists of a set of subjects, each scanned twice several months
apart. For simplicity's sake, we will look for a simple mean effect across
subjects and sessions. Hopefully this will help you understand how this analysis can be
extended to more complex questions.
</p>


<p>
We want the mean group effect, within a mixed effects model,
taking into account the within-subject fixed effects variances and the
between-subject random effect variance. This is done in THREE levels:
</p>


<ul class="no-pad">

  <li><b>Level 1: Within-session analysis</b>. There are 5 subjects &times; 2
  sessions = 10 of these first level FEAT analyses, which have already been
  done for you.</li>

  <li><b>Level 2: Between-session analysis</b>. Here, we input the data from
  Level 1, and estimate each subject's mean response.</li>

  <li><b>Level 3: Between-subject analysis</b>. We input the data
  corresponding to the subject means from Level 2, model the between-subject
  variances and estimate the group mean response.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Because each subject will typically only have a handful of sessions, we do
<em>not</em> run a <i>mixed effects</i> second-level analysis to get an
estimation of each subject's mean response. The reason for this is that we
would not be able to get a good estimation of the within-subject
session-to-session variance with a limited number of sessions. Hence we choose
to ignore the session-to-session variance by using a <i>fixed effects</i>
analysis at this second level. See <span class="clickme"
onclick="showIt('multisession#fixedeffects')">here</span> for a more involved
discussion of the choice of a fixed effects analysis.
</p>


<div id="multisession#fixedeffects" class="answer" style="display: none;">
  <p>If you are carrying out a mid-level analysis (e.g., cross-session) that
  will be fed into an even higher-level analysis (e.g., cross-subject), then
  it could be argued that a mixed-effects analysis should be done at the
  mid-level. A mixed-effects analysis would assume that the sessions are
  randomly sampled from a <em>population</em> of sessions that that subject
  could produce. This includes estimation of each subject's session-to-session
  variance. However, it is common for only a small number of sessions to be
  collected for each subject, making estimation of each subject's
  session-to-session variance impractical. One solution to this is to assume a
  common session-to-session variance for all subjects, thereby providing
  enough data for the session-to-session variance to be estimated. However,
  this has a downside in that you lose information about which subjects are
  good (i.e. low variance) and which subjects are bad (i.e. high variance).
  Hence, when only a small number of sessions have been collected for each
  subject (say, less than 10), it is recommended that you use a fixed effects
  analysis at the mid-level. This in effect treats the multiple first-level
  sessions (for each subject) as if they were one long session, and estimates the simple average across the sessions. Although this
  does ignore the session-to-session variability at this level, it is arguable
  that this is not of interest anyway (this is a somewhat philosophical
  debate).  However, the combined session and subject variability will still
  affect (and be estimated at) the next level. </p>


  <p>In short, fixed effects is favoured as it avoids practical problems
  associated with estimating the session-to-session variance (when there are
  not many sessions per subject), at the same time as maintaining information
  about which subjects are good and bad (i.e. low or high variance).</p>
</div>


<p>
In addition to this, the analysis cannot be combined into a single second-level
analysis. This is tempting as a design matrix can easily be formed containing
each subject's mean (across sessions) as a separate EV, and then contrasts
can be formed to test the mean across all subjects. The problem with this
model is that there are two separate sources of variability (session-to-session
and subject-to-subject) but, within FSL, a single level cannot model more than 
one separate sources of variance.
<!-- they cannot be modelled properly (with the correct weighting) in a single level. -->
</p>


<!-- ++++++++++ -->

<h4>First-level analyses</h4>

<p>
In both sessions, subjects performed the "Pyramids &amp; Palm Trees" task
(PPTT). Participants are presented with a target image, and are asked to select
the image they most associate with the target from a pair of additional
images. The canonical example is below:
</p>

<div class="centred">
<a href="PPTT_example.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="PPTT_example.jpg" alt="Example stimulus"
     width=450" />
</a>
</div>


<p>
This is meant to be a test of semantic memory, as the task requires reasoning
about the links between objects. There is also a control condition, where
participants have to match abstract line drawings. We are primarily interested
in the <i>semantic &gt; lines</i> responses. To begin with, familiarise
yourself with the first-level design and typical responses in one of the
session-specific FEAT analyses we have run for you:
</p>


<pre class="bash">
cd ~/fsl_course_data/fmri2/3_levels
</pre>


<p>
Take a quick look at one of the web reports within the run directories of the
<code>level_1/</code> directory.
</p>


<!-- ++++++++++ -->


<h4>Second-level analysis</h4>


<p>
We will now set up the second-level (i.e. within-subject) analysis. Open FEAT
(<code class="bash">Feat &amp;</code> [or <code class="bash">Feat_gui
&amp;</code> if on a mac]) and follow the instructions below:
</p>


<ul class="pad-after">


  <li>Change <b>First-level analysis</b> to <b>Higher-level analysis</b>.</li>


  <li> Change the <b>Number of inputs</b> to 10 (5 subjects &times; 2
  sessions).</li>


  <li>
  <p>Press <b>Select FEAT directories</b>. Again, you need to specify the
  first-level FEAT directories in a sensible order: subject 1, sessions 1, 2;
  then subject 2, sessions 1, 2; etc. There are lots of ways we can enter 
  these into the GUI: we can enter them individually into the GUI by hand, 
  but this can be laborious for large studies; we can type out the names in a 
  file and use the <b>Paste</b> window; or we could do some simple <code>ls</code> commands 
  and then reorder the outputs as necesary in a text editor. Finally, if we 
  have chosen a sensible naming convention we may be able to script the 
  whole process.</p>

  <p>To save time, we will use a command to generate the names we need.</p>
<p>
To generate the list, use the command given 
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt('multisession#pastecommand')">here</span>.
</p>

  <p><div id="multisession#pastecommand" class="answer" style="display: none;">
  <pre class="bash">
for sub in CON_417 CON_425 CON_428 CON_429 CON_430 ; do 
  ls -1d $PWD/level_1/run_1/$sub/*.feat ; 
  ls -1d $PWD/level_1/run_2/${sub}_2/*.feat ; 
done
</pre>
  <p>Note how this command is more complicated than the ones we have used 
  to generate file lists before. This is because of the naming convention we have 
  chosen! Setting up a sensible naming convention from the start will make 
  subsequent analyses immeasurably easier.</p>
  </div></p>

  <p>Select the text and right-click copy the generated list of names. Paste this text (control-y) in the <b>Paste</b> window. 
  
  </li>

<!--
<pre class="bash">
for subject in level_1/run_1/*; do
  subject=$(basename "$subject")
  ls -1d "$PWD"/level_1/run_?/"$subject"*/*.feat
done
</pre>
-->

  <li> To save time, we will only pass the <i>semantic &gt; lines</i> and
  <i>semantic &lt; lines</i> contrasts up to the higher levels. Make sure
  that <b>ONLY</b> contrasts 1 &amp; 2 are selected in the <b>Use
  lower-level copes</b> boxes.</li>


  <li> Set the <b>Output directory</b> to
  <code>level_2</code>
  </li>

  <li> Go to the <b>Stats</b> tab and select the <b>Fixed-effects</b>
  option.</li>

  <li> Press <b>Full model setup</b>. Remember that the <em>Inputs</em> (1-10)
  correspond to the order you entered the first-level FEAT directories. As
  this is a fixed effects analysis the <em>Group</em> column is ignored so
  leave all these entries as 1 (<em>if</em> we had lots of sessions and did a
  mixed effects analysis instead then we would use a unique number in this
  column for each subject (i.e. within each subject we would estimate a
  separate variance).</li>


  <li>We need 5 EVs: one for each subject mean. Change the 0s to 1s
  appropriately, in such a way that each EV models a different subject mean.
  We then need to pass the 5 parameter estimates (PEs) corresponding to the 5
  subject means through to the third level as COPEs. To enable this, we need
  to have a contrast for each subject mean that just selects that parameter.
  Set the contrasts appropriately. Your design matrix should now match this
  <span class="clickme" onclick="showIt('multisession#level2design')">complete
  design matrix.</span>

  <p><div id="multisession#level2design" class="answer" style="display: none;">
  <img src="level_2_design.png" alt="Level 2 design matrix" align="middle" width=300 />
  </div></p>
  </li>


  <li> Press <b>Done</b>. The default <b>Post-stats</b> are fine (in fact, the
  post-stats don't affect what gets passed up to third-level). You are now
  ready to run the second-level analysis so press <b>Go</b>!</li>
</ul>

<div class="aside">
If something has gone wrong with your analysis, or it is taking too long to run, 
there is a pre-baked version available: <code>examples/level_2.gfeat</code>. 
You can use this as the input to the third level analysis too if necessary.
</div>

<p> This analysis should only take a couple of minutes to run. Wait for the
result web pages and then view them <em>carefully</em>. Check that the
registrations are accurate, and then take a look at the results.
</p>




<!-- ++++++++++ -->

<h4>Third-level analysis</h4>


<p>
We are now ready to set up the third-level (i.e. between-subject) analysis.
This will be valid for one of the contrasts we passed up to the second level
(but it easy to repeat the analysis for the others). We will use the
<i>semantic &gt; lines</i> results, which corresponds to contrast 1.
Reopen FEAT (<code>Feat &amp;</code>) and follow the instructions below:
</p>


<ul class="pad-after">

  <li>Change <b>First-level analysis</b> to <b>Higher-level analysis</b>.</li>

  <li>Change <b>Inputs are lower-level FEAT directories</b> to <b>Inputs are
  3D cope images from FEAT directories</b>. The inputs will be the 5 COPE
  images, one for each subject mean, from the second-level analysis.</li>

  <li> Change the <b>Number of inputs</b> to 5 (each corresponding to a
  subject mean).</li>

  <li><p>Press <b>Select cope images</b> and enter the COPEs from the second
  level.  These will be inside the <code>cope1.feat/stats</code> directory
  which is inside the second-level <code>level_2.gfeat</code> directory that
  you just created. The relevant command for pasting is:</p>


<pre class="bash">

</pre>

<div class="quiz_question">

  <li> Set the output directory to <code>level_3</code></li>

  <li> Go to the <b>Stats</b> tab and change to <b>Fixed effects</b>. Note
  that this is <b>NOT</b> recommended for group-level analyses, but we use
  it here to save time and because we are only analysing five
  subjects. Normally, mixed effects would be used.</li>

  <li> Use the <b>Model setup wizard</b> to generate a <em>single group
  average</em> design.</li>

  <li>Press <b>Go</b>!</li>
</ul>


<div class="aside">
You can look at <code>examples/level_3.gfeat</code> if necessary.
</div>

<p> Again, this analysis should only take a couple of minutes to run. Wait for
the result web pages and look at the results. Do they look plausible?
