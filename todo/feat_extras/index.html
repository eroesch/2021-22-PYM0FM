<p>This practical contains an overview of some advanced analysis methods
available in FEAT. It leads you through some of the more advanced usage and
concepts in both single-session and higher-level FEAT analyses. Feel free to
do the latter two sections in a different order if you are particularly
interested in any of them.

<h2><a name="custom">Custom Waveforms</a></h2>


<p>
It is possible to specify EVs in FEAT using Custom Waveforms. Here, a
simulated dataset (with reduced FOV) has been generated with some event-related conditions to
model.
</p>


<pre class="bash">
cd ~/fsl_course_data/fmri_extras/custom_waveforms
</pre>

<p>
Open FEAT (<code class="bash">Feat &amp;</code>
[or <code class="bash">Feat_gui &amp;</code> on Mac]) and follow the
instructions below.
</p>


<ul class="pad-after">

  <li>Select the data <code>artdata.nii.gz</code> (you may get a warning about
    pre-set options, you can ignore it). This dataset has already been
    preprocessed, so change <b>Full analysis</b> to <b>Statistics </b>. </li>

  <li>Go to <b>Full model setup</b> (under the <b>Stats</b> tab) and set 3 EVs
    (there are three different things going on in the data with their own
    timings). We will convolve all of these EVs with a gamma function.</li>

  <li>Condition 1 is a boxcar (square wave) design so set <em>EV1</em> to be
    Off=20 On=20 Phase=10.</li>


  <li>Condition 2 is a jittered event-related design with
    inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) &gt; 20s and mean(ISI)=25s; so set EV2's
    <b>Basic shape</b> to <em>custom (3 column format)</em>; select the
    filename as <code>jittered_isi_custom_file.dat</code>. In the terminal
    have a quick look at the custom file with the <code>less</code>
    command. The 3 columns are explained in the
    <a href="../../../../fsl/fslwiki/FEAT/UserGuide.html#EVs" target="_blank">FEAT
    user guide</a>. </li>


  <li>Condition 3 is randomised event-related with ISI>3s and mean(ISI)=6s;
    set EV3's shape to <em>custom (3 column format)</em>; select the filename
    as <code>rand_isi_custom_file.dat</code>. </li>


  <li>Set 3 contrasts [1 0 0] [0 1 0] and [0 0 1] and an F-test [1 1 1] - that
    is, select all three t-contrasts to be part of the
    F-test. Press <B>Done</B>. Press <b>Go</b> and wait for exciting results!
    On the FEAT report page look at the time series plots of data vs
    model. </li>


  <li>If you have time, have a detailed look at the timeseries plots in
    the <b>Post-stats</b> section of the webpage report. For example, click on
    the <b>zstat1</b> timeseries plot, to see more information about the
    fitting related to contrast 1. Find the <b>Peristimulus plot</b> for EV1;
    this shows the data points for all repeats of the condition described in
    EV1, collapsed down to one &quot;average&quot; version of that
    stimulus. In this case this means all repeats of the basic block-design
    on-off shape. Now go back and click on the <b>zstat2</b> timeseries plot,
    to see more information about the fitting related to contrast 2. Find
    the <b>Peristimulus plot</b> for EV3; in this case the plot is showing
    all repeats of the brief event. </li>


  <li>Now start <code class="bash">fsleyes</code>, load in
    the <code>filtered_func_data</code> image in the FEAT output directory, and
    select <em>View -&gt; Layouts -&gt; FEAT mode</em>. You should be able to
    see the data timeseries, and the model fit for the current voxel. If you now
    open the time series control panel (<em>Settings -&gt; Time series 2 -&gt;
    Time series control</em>), expand the <em>Time series settings for artdata:
    filtered_func_data</em> section, and check the <em>Plot COPE1 fit</em> box,
    you will see the data, full model fit, and the COPE1 fit, for the current
    voxel. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="outlierinf">Outlier Inference</a></h2>


<p>
In this section we look at the output that is generated when outlier
de-weighting is used. This is used in higher-level FEAT analyses, and can be
selected under the <b>Stats</b> tab. Note that outlier de-weighting can be
performed for any of the mixed effects analyses, but is not applicable to
a fixed effects analysis.
</p>


<p>
In the interest of time, we have provided you with the stripped down results
of a group Feat analysis that has been setup and run with outlier de-weighting
for you.
</p>


<p>
The experiment is looking to infer the group mean effect over a group of 18
subjects. The effect of interest is the BOLD response in the feedback phase of
a decision making experiment.
</p>


<p>
Move into the group Feat directory corresponding to this lower-level contrast:
</p>


<pre class="bash">
cd ~/fsl_course_data/fmri_extras/outliers/decmak.gfeat/cope1.feat
</pre>


<p>Inside the <code>stats</code> directory are the results of the higher level
run with outlier inference turned on. Take a look at the files in that
directory:
</p>


<pre class="bash">ls stats</pre>


<p>The <code>prob_outlier1.nii.gz</code> file is a 4D nifti file giving the
probability that each subject has outlier data on a voxelwise
basis. The <code>global_prob_outlier1.nii.gz</code> file is a 3D nifti file
that indicates the proportion of the subjects classified as outliers at each
voxel (see the lecture for more details). Note there are versions of these
files for each variance group in the analysis. In this case, there was only
one variance group.</p>


<p>
Load the <code>global_prob_outlier1</code> file into FSLeyes.
</p>

<pre class="bash">fsleyes stats/global_prob_outlier1.nii.gz</pre>
<p>Use <em>File &gt; Add standard</em> to load in the MNI standard
brain <code>MNI152_T1_2mm_brain</code>.  Use <em>File &gt; Add overlay from
file</em> to load in the <code>prob_outlier1</code> file, and also load in the
<code>filtered_func_data</code> in the
<code>~/fsl_course_data/fmri_extras/outliers/decmak.gfeat/cope1.feat</code>
directory. Note that the <code>filtered_func_data</code> file is a 4D nifti
file of the 18 subjects' first-level effect sizes (COPEs) at each voxel, in
other words the &quot;data&quot; that gets used to calculate the group average
at each voxel.
</p>

<p>Open a time series view, via <em>View -&gt; Time series</em>. Make sure
that the time series for both the <code>prob_outlier1</code>
and <code>filtered_func_data</code> images will be plotted by toggling them on
(the <img src="eye_icon.png" class="icon"/> button in the list to the left of
the plot). And set the <b>Plotting mode</b> to <em>Normalised</em>, so the
different time courses have the same range, and can thus be easily
compared. Then hide the <code>prob_outlier1</code>
and <code>filtered_func_data</code> images (again, the <img src="eye_icon.png"
class="icon"/> button, but this time in the list just below the ortho view) so
that they do not get displayed on the spatial map. </p>


<p>Navigate around the brain to see where outlier behaviour occurs, and see
how this relates to the data in the <code>filtered_func_data</code> timeseries
plots and to the probability that each subject has outlier data in
the <code>prob_outlier1.nii.gz</code> timeseries plots. Which subject is
causing the most outlier behaviour? </p>


<p>Inside the <code>stats</code> directory is the file
<code>zstat1</code>. These are the z-stats resulting from the higher level
analysis run with the outlier inference turned off (note that this would not
normally be available when you have run outlier inference - it is provided for
you here to allow you to make comparisons). Use <em>File->Add overaly from
file</em> to load <code>zstat1</code> into FSLeyes for the analyses with
outlier de-weighting
(<code>~/fsl_course_data/fmri_extras/outliers/decmak.gfeat/cope1.feat/stats/zstat1_no_outliers</code>)
and without outlier de-weighting
(<code>~/fsl_course_data/fmri_extras/outliers/decmak.gfeat/cope1.feat/stats/zstat1</code>).
Take a look at how the zstats are changed when there are outliers detected.

<h2><a name="basisfunctions">HRF Basis Functions</a></h2>


<p>
This section shows you how basis functions can be setup and used in FEAT. The
dataset we will use is a jittered single-event experiment with 200 time
points. The stimulus is heat applied for 3 seconds with an average
inter-stimulus interval of 70 secs. We will only analyze one slice to allow
for quick processing.
</p>


<pre class="bash">
cd ~/fsl_course_data/fmri_extras/flobs
Feat &amp;
</pre>


<ul class="pad-after">


  <li>Press <b>Select 4D data</b> and select <code>filtdata.nii.gz</code>.
    This dataset has already been preprocessed, so change <b>Full analysis</b>
    to <b>Statistics</b>. </li>


  <li>Set the <b>High pass filter cutoff</b> to 50sec.</li>

  <li>Setup one EV using the Custom (3 column format)
    file <code>pain_paradigm.txt</code>.  Note that this is the underlying
    experimental stimulus and is assumed to also correspond to the neuronal
    response to the stimulus. This needs to be convolved with our assumed
    HRF.</li>
</ul>


<p> To start with we will analyze the dataset assuming a fixed Gamma HRF (no
basis functions) and then compare the results with a set of the optimal linear
basis functions.</p>


<ul class="pad-after">

  <li> Hence, for the EV leave the <b>Convolution</b> as <b>Gamma</b>, BUT
    turn OFF <b>Add temporal derivative</b> as we want to show the results for
    when a simple, fixed HRF is assumed.</li>


  <li>Take a look at the contrasts - the default OC1 contrast
  of <code>[1]</code> is fine. You need to also make an F-contrast consisting
  only of ev1 so that we can compare it to what we will do later.</li>

  <li>Press <b>Done</b> and view the design.</li>

  <li>Take a look at the <b>Post-stats</b> tab - the defaults are fine.</li>


  <li>Press <b>Go</b> and wait for the results. On the FEAT report
    page look at the time series plots of data vs model.</li>
</ul>


<p>We will now process the same data using FMRIB's Linear Optimal Basis Set
  (FLOBS) and compare the results. Kill and
  restart <code class="bash">Feat</code>, and then follow the instructions
  below.</p>


<ul class="pad-after">

  <li>Press <b>Load</b> and select the <b>design.fsf</b> file in
    the <b>filtdata.feat</b> created from the fixed Gamma HRF analysis we have
    just performed. This loads up the design we just used - saving us the
    effort of having to setup many of the same options again. </li>


  <li>The only bit we need to change is in <b>Full model setup</b> in
    the <b>Stats</b> tab. We need to change the
    <b>Convolution</b> option to <b>Optimal/custom basis functions</b>.</li>


  <li>We can now specify the FMRIB's Linear Optimal Basis Set (FLOBS)
    filename we wish to use. By default the FLOBS provided in
    <code>$FSLDIR/etc/default_flobs.flobs</code> is used - so leave that
    selected. You can generate your own customised FLOBS by
    selecting <em>Utils &gt; Make_flobs</em> on the main FEAT setup GUI (if
    you have time later then come back and try generating your own basis
    functions with this GUI and feed that into FEAT). </li>

  <li>Now go to the <b>Contrasts and F-tests</b> tab. Change the number of
    F-tests back to zero - when using basis functions, an F-test will be
    automatically set up for you, so you do not need to manually add one. </li>

  <li>Now, we have two ways of setting up contrasts with basis functions. This
    is via consideration of the <em>Original EVs</em> or the <em>Real
    EVs</em>. </li>

  <li>The default is to work with the <em>Original EVs</em>.  Original EVs
    correspond to the true underlying effects/conditions in the
    experiment. Hence, to investigate if the effect is significant, a simple
    OC1 contrast <code>[1]</code> suffices. </li>


  <li> Now press <b>View Design</b> and the actual design matrix to be used is
    displayed.  This shows one EV for each of the basis functions convolved
    with the experimental stimulus.  The single <em>Original EV</em> is
    automatically expanded into the <em>Real EVs</em> (in this case 3 EVs) that need to be actually
    used in the design matrix when modelling with basis functions. Note that
    the OC1 <code>[1]</code> contrast will be actually carried out by the F1 f
    contrast. Why is this the correct way to do the test?</li>


  <li> Return to <b>Contrasts and F-tests</b> and change <b>Original EVs</b>
    to <b>Real EVs</b>. The single Original EV is again automatically expanded
    into the Real EVs actually used in the design matrix, but now you have
    control of the actual contrast settings used. </li>


  <li> Again press <b>View Design</b> and the design should be exactly the
    same as it was before. </li>


  <li> Press <b>Done</b> and then press <b>Go</b> and wait for the results.
    Take a look at the FEAT report. In particular, look at the peristimulus
    (PST) plots by clicking on the model fit plots.  The peristimulus plots
    show the fits to a single epoch of stimulation.  The data actually
    acquired at each repeat of the stimulation is plotted as a scatter of
    points. The <em>full model fit</em> on the peristimulus plot indicates the
    HRF formed by fitting the basis set to the data. </li>


  <li> Compare this FEAT report with the FEAT report from the single HRF Gamma
    run previously. Are there any differences? </li>


  <li>If you get time at the end of this session try running a range of
    different basis sets, e.g. Sinusoidal, FIR. In particular, have a go at
    making your own customised basis set (FLOBS) using <em>Utils &gt;
    Make_flobs</em> on the main FEAT setup GUI. </li>
</ul>
