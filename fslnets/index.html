<title>Resting state FSLnets practical</title>
</head>


<body>
<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Resting state FSLnets practical</h1>

<p>This is the version of the FSL practical adjusted for use in PYM0FM, to be used on the CINN Nutanix Platform. Consequently, there are a few things you need to keep in mind:
<ul>
     <li>The data is not stored in your home folder (~/fsl_course_data), and instead it is stored in the shared pym0fm drive, located at <code>/storage/silver/pym0fm/&lt;your DTS login&gt;/fsl_course_data</code>.</li>
     <li>We are using virtual machines that are preconfigured for neuroimaging work. Our researchers typically use both FSL verion 5 and 6, and to avoid conflict we are containing version of the software in modules. When you start a new terminal session, whether you start a new analysis, or you just closed one terminal, you will have to type <code>module load fsl6.0</code>, each time.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><center>---</center></p>

<p><b>FSLNets</b> is a toolbox for carrying out basic network modelling from FMRI timeseries data.
  It is a collection of MATLAB or Octave scripts that run a connectivity analysis
  between sets of timeseries. </p>

<p>Estimating network matrices and performing statistical analyses on these requires
the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Extracting subject-specific timeseries relating to a given set of spatial maps of nodes.
    For example, using dual regression stage 1
    outputs</li>

  <li>Looking for group-level noise components that you want to remove</li>

  <li>Calculating correlations (full or partial) between all pairs of timeseries
    to build the network matrix (netmat) for each subject</li>

  <li>Looking at the group-average network matrix and how nodes cluster together
    into a hierarchy</li>

  <li>Performing group-level statistical analysis</li>
</ol>

</dl>

<p>In the next sections we will go through an example of how perform network modelling using
  resting-state data (i.e. the output from melodic followed by stage 1 of dual regression). However, with FSLNets you can
  analyse any set of timeseries!</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a name="before"></a>Before running FSLnets</a></h2>

<p> Before you run FSLnets, you need to prepare several things:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Define 'nodes'</b></li>
<p> The nodes are the spatial maps that define the regions included in our network modelling.
  Nodes can be defined in a number of ways, but for this practical we have already generated the nodes for you
  using the following group ICA command to extract 100 components (please do not run this again): </p>

<pre class="dontrun">
melodic -i input_files.txt -o groupICA100 \
  --tr=0.72 --nobet -a concat \
  --bgimage=$FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.nii.gz \
  -m $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm_brain_mask.nii.gz \
  --report --Oall -d 100
</pre>

<div class="aside">
Nodes could also be defined using anatomical or functional atlases, although anatomical atlases may not provide good functional parcellations as the structural boundaries are not always a good estimate of functional boundaries.</a>
</div>

<li> <b>Extract timeseries from nodes </b></li>
<p>To look at the temporal relationship between our nodes, we must first extract the timeseries from each node.
  Again, the timeseries extraction can be done in a number of ways. For this practical, we have already extracted
  the timeseries from the 100 nodes by running dual regression with the command below, and using the stage 1 output. </p>

  <pre class="dontrun">
dual_regression groupICA100/melodic_IC 1 -1 0 groupICA100.dr `cat input_files.txt`
  </pre>

<li><b> Create images of nodes </b></li>
<p> For visualisation purposes, FSLnets requires a PNG image of each node.
  We have created these for you (located in <code>/storage/silver/pym0fm/&lt;your DTS login&gt;/fsl_course_data/rest/Nets/group100.sum</code>) using the following command: </p>

<pre class="dontrun">slices_summary groupICA100/melodic_IC 4 $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm groupICA100.sum -1</pre>

<p>This command takes the 4D image containing the group ICA components (<code>groupICA100/melodic_IC</code>),
  sets a minimum threshold of 4, specifies the MNI152_T1_2mm as the background image,
  and creates the output directory group100.sum, which contains the png images of each node.
  The -1 flag specifies that single-slice summaries should be generated instead of 3-slice summaries. </p>

</ul>

<hr/>
<h2><a name="configuration">Octave configuration</a></h2>

<p>To start this FSLNets network modelling practical, open a terminal and cd
to the working directory of this practical, then start Octave:</p>


<pre class="bash">
cd /storage/silver/pym0fm/&lt;your DTS login&gt;/fsl_course_data/rest/Nets
octave
</pre>

<p>Add the folder containing the scripts we are going to use to the path, and
setup a few variables:</p>


<pre class="matlab">
addpath /storage/silver/pym0fm/&lt;your DTS login&gt;/fsl_course_data/rest/FSLNets
addpath(sprintf('%s/etc/matlab',getenv('FSLDIR')))
addpath /storage/silver/pym0fm/&lt;your DTS login&gt;/fsl_course_data/rest/octave/libsvm/matlab
pkg load statistics
</pre>


<hr/>
<h2><a name="networks_estimation">Networks estimation</a></h2>


<p>Now we are ready to start setting up some important parts for our network
modelling analysis. To load in all subjects' timeseries data files from the
dual-regression output directory, run:</p>


<pre class="matlab">
ts = nets_load('groupICA100.dr', 0.72, 0);
</pre>


<p>Type <code>fieldnames(ts)</code> and hit enter to have a look at the contents of the structure that was created using this command.
  <code>ts.ts</code> contains the stage 1 dual regression timeseries from all subjects.
  Try to figure out what information the other variables in the structure <code>ts</code> contain.</p>

<div class="viz-graph">
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=box];
  1 [label="dual regression output folder
('groupICA100.dr')"];
  2 [label="repetition time (TR)

  3 [label="normalisation of timeseries

  5 [label="output structure with subfields
(ts)"];
  1 -> 4;
  2 -> 4;
  3 -> 4;
  4 -> 5;
}
</div>


<p>We will now have a quick look at the temporal spectra of the resting state networks (RSNs), as a
quick check that these look reasonable. Running the following command will
open a figure in which the left part of the plot shows one spectrum per
group-ICA component, each averaged across all subjects. The right part shows
the same thing, but with all spectra overlapping. </p>


<pre class="matlab">
ts_spectra = nets_spectra(ts);

</p>

<div id="spectra_figure_explanation" class="answer" style="display: none">
<p>The spectra should fall off smoothly with increasing frequency.

<div class="quiz_question">
  <span class="question">Why do the figures show that all nodes have high

  </form>
</div>

<h3>Cleaning components </h3>
<p>There is the option to remove components' (nodes') timeseries that
correspond to artefacts rather than plausible nodes. Similarly to the last
practical, you need to decide this by looking at the spatial maps,
timeseries, and frequency spectra. To save time, we have listed the good
components for you. Run the following commands to list the good components and
apply the cleanup:</p>


<pre class="matlab">
ts.DD = [1:3,5,6:9,11:13,17:23,25:38,40,42,43,47:50,52,53,55:59,61,...
62,64:66,70:74,77,80,81,86,87,93,97];
ts = nets_tsclean(ts,1);
</pre>


<div class="viz-graph">
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=box];

  2 [label="aggressive or soft cleanup

  3 [label="nets_tsclean"];
  4 [label="output structure

  1 -> 3;
  2 -> 3;
  3 -> 4;
}
</div>

<p> </p>

<div class="quiz_question">

    <span id="option2" class="answer incorrect">Incorrect! Simply removing timeseries is called soft cleanup. </span><br/>
  </form>
</div>


<h3>Calculating netmats for each subject </h3>
<p>Now you are ready to compute a network matrix for each subject, which is in
general a matrix of correlation strengths (correlation coefficients). We will compute two different versions of these <em>netmats</em> for
each subject: a simple full correlation (<code>'corr'</code>), and a partial correlation
that has been <em>regularised</em> in order to potentially improve the
mathematical robustness of the estimation (<code>'ridgep'</code>). The partial correlation
matrix should do a better job of only estimating the direct network
connections than the full correlation does.</p>


<pre class="matlab">
Fnetmats = nets_netmats(ts,1,'corr');
Pnetmats = nets_netmats(ts,1,'ridgep',0.1);
</pre>


<div class="viz-graph">
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=box];
  1 [label="inputs structure
(ts)"];
  2 [label="apply Fisher's r-to-z transformation?
(1) i.e. yes"];
  3 [label="method for netmat estimation
('ridgep') i.e. regularised partial correlation"];
  4 [label="regularisation parameter
(0.1)"];
  5 [label="nets_netmats"];
  6 [label="output variable
(Pnetmats)"];
  1 -> 5;
  2 -> 5;
  3 -> 5;
  4 -> 5;
  5 -> 6;
}
</div>


<p>The full and partial netmats are now calculated for all subjects.
  Now run this command to look at the size of the <code>Fnetmats</code> variable:</p>

<pre class="matlab">
size(Fnetmats)
</pre>

<p> Can you figure out how the netmats of all subjects are saved in this? <span class="clickme" onclick="showIt('Fnetmats explanation')">Answer.</span></p>

<div id="Fnetmats explanation" class="answer" style="display: none">
The number of rows is equal to the number of subjects. Each node-by-node network matrix is reshaped into a single line (i.e. number of nodes * number of nodes).
</div>

<p>In the next section, you are going to compute the group average and take a look at the average network matrix.</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a name="group_average">Group-average netmat summaries</a></h2>

<p>We have computed the full and partial network matrices for each individual subject.
  The next step is to perform a simple group-level analysis
  to look at the mean network matrix across all subjects.
  This can be done using the command below, which saves out both the simple average of
  netmats accross all subjects (<code>Mnet</code>) and the results of a simple one-group t-test (against zero) across subjects as Z values (<code>Znet</code>).</p>

<div class="aside">
To calculate the group average netmat, each individual's netmat is unwrapped into a row and combined to create a subjects * edges matrix.
The average edge strength is then calcualted across subjects. </a>
</div>

<pre class="matlab">
[Znet_F,Mnet_F]=nets_groupmean(Fnetmats,0);
[Znet_P,Mnet_P]=nets_groupmean(Pnetmats,1);
</pre>

<p>The second input to this command indicates whether or not to display a summary figure.
  This is set to 1 for the second command run on the partial netmats, so the summary figure for this will show up.
  On the left, this figure shows the results from the group t-test, and on the right is a consistency scatter plot
  showing how similar the results from each subject are to the group (i.e. the more this looks like a diagonal line,
  the more consistent the relevant netmat is across subjects).</p>

</div>

<h3>Group average network hierarchy </h3>

<p>The next thing we can look at is how nodes cluster together to form larger
resting state networks. For this we run a clustering method that groups nodes
together based on their covariance structure. To view this network hierarchy, run:</p>


<pre class="matlab">
nets_hierarchy(Znet_F,Znet_P,ts.DD,'groupICA100.sum');
</pre>

</p>
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt('hierarchy_figure_explanation')">Click here for more information on how to read the figure</span>
</p>


<div id="hierarchy_figure_explanation" class="answer" style="display: none">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="hierarchy.png" alt="Figure 1" vspace="15" width="70%"></p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<div class="viz-graph">
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box];
  1 [label="group-averaged netmat to drive clustering
(Znet_F) shown below the diagonal"];
  2 [label="group-average netmat to show (doesn't drive clustering)
(Znet_P) shown above the diagonal"];
  3 [label="list of good components

  4 [label="directory containing png summary figures

  5 [label="nets_hierarchy = the FSLnets command we are running"];
  1 -> 5;
  2 -> 5;
  3 -> 5;
  4 -> 5;
}
</div>


<p>You can see, for example, that 8 nodes have been grouped together which
form of a large-scale resting state network called the default mode network
that you may have heard about.</p>


<hr/>
<h2><a name="subject_comparison">Cross-subject comparison with netmats</a></h2>


<p>We are now able to test whether the netmats differ significantly between
healthy controls and patients with a tumor using a two-sample t-test. This is
a 'univariate' test, as we will test each network matrix edge separately for a
group-difference, and then we will estimate p-values for these tests,
correcting for multiple comparisons across all tests. By analogy to
high-level task-fMRI analyses: you can think of each subject's netmat as being
an NxN image of voxels, and the univariate testing as modelling each voxel (in
isolation from each other) across subjects.</p>

<p>We have already created the design files for you to run the two-sample t-test.
If you want to look at the design, open the GLM GUI (in a new terminal window) and load the <code>/storage/silver/pym0fm/&lt;your DTS login&gt;/fsl_course_data/rest/Nets/design/unpaired_ttest_1con.fsf</code> file
(ignore the error message, go to the 'stats' tab and click 'full model setup' to be able to see the design).</p>

To perform the comparison run the following command (which calls <code>randomise</code> from within Octave, with 5000
permutations for each contrast):</p>

<pre class="matlab">
[p_uncorr,p_corr]=nets_glm(Pnetmats,'design/unpaired_ttest_1con.mat','design/unpaired_ttest_1con.con',1);
</pre>


<div class="viz-graph">
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=box];
  1 [label="input to t-test
(Pnetmats)"];
  2 [label="EVs of group-level design
('design/paired_ttest.mat')
use GLM gui to create this"];
  3 [label="contrasts of group-level design
('design/paired_ttest.con')
use GLM gui to create this"];
  4 [label="create output figure?
(1) i.e. yes"];
  5 [label="nets_glm"];
  6 [label="variable containing uncorrected p-values
(p_uncorr)"];
  7 [label="variable containing p-values corrected for multiple comparisons
(p_corr)"]
  1 -> 5;
  2 -> 5;
  3 -> 5;
  4 -> 5;
  5 -> 6;
  5 -> 7;
}
</div>


<p>Once randomise has finished, you will see a figure showing
&quot;netmats&quot; containing corrected p-values. The results above the
diagonal show edges where the two-group t-test is significant, at
corrected-p&lt;0.05.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="glm.png" alt="Figure 1" vspace="15" width="35%"></p>
</div>

<h3> Displaying significant group differences</h3>

<p>We will now run a command that shows which nodes were linked to the
significant differences between the groups:</p>


<pre class="matlab">
nets_edgepics(ts,'groupICA100.sum',Znet_P,reshape(p_corr,ts.Nnodes,ts.Nnodes),1);
</pre>

</p>
<span class="clickme" onclick="showIt('edge_figure_explanation')">Click here for more information on how to read the figure</span>
</p>


<div id="edge_figure_explanation" class="answer" style="display: none">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="edge.png" alt="Figure 1" vspace="15" width="30%"></p>
</div>

<p>
Each pair of thumbnails corresponds to one position in the NxN network matrix
and the node numbers are listed in the text captions. The coloured bar joining
each pair of nodes tells you what the overall group-average connection strength
is: thicker means a stronger connection; red means it's positive, and blue means
that the connection is "negative" (meaning that the two nodes tend to
anti-correlate on average). The "value" numbers tell you the 1-p-values - so the
higher these are, the more significantly different this edge strength is between
the two groups. Anything less than 0.95 is not significant, after correcting for
multiple comparisons.
</p>

<h3> Displaying boxplots </h3>

<p>In addition, we also want to show how the partial correlation differs
between the patients and the controls and these two significant edges. To do
this, run:</p>


<pre class="matlab">
nets_boxplots(ts,Pnetmats,57,33,6);
</pre>


<p>The boxplots summarize the distributions of the correlation values
(connection strengths) in the two groups - <b>A</b> being healthy controls
and <b>B</b> being tumour patients - for this one particular node-pair
(57,33).</p>

</p>

<h2><a name="multivariate_analysis">(Optional) Multivariate cross-subject analysis
</a></h2>


<p>Finally, we will now carry out multivariate cross-subject analysis -
meaning that, instead of considering each netmat edge in isolation (like we
did above) we will consider the whole netmat in one analysis.</p>


<p>For example, we can attempt to classify subjects into patients or controls
using machine learning methods, such as support vector machines (SVM) or
linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Such methods look at the overall pattern
of values in the netmat, and try to learn how the overall pattern changes
between the two groups.</p>


<p>The following command feeds the regularised partial correlation netmats
from both groups into LDA. It uses a method known as leave-one-out
cross-validation to train and test a classifier, and reports in what
percentage of tests it was successful at discriminating between patients and
controls:</p>


<pre class="matlab">
nets_lda(Pnetmats,6,2)
</pre>


<p>You can also try using other classifiers, for example by changing the last
entry from 2 to 1 (type <code>help nets_lda</code> for further details).</p>
